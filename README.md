# Clear Dependencies Plug-In

<!-- Plugin description -->

As we all know, optimal dependencies between classes, packages, components etc. are essential for the life and survival of the software product. Yet we naturally spend most of our developent time looking at code, as dependencies were barely existing. But they do, and, oh boy, how the do it. When not being taken care of, they grow and grow in count, assuring us hard hours and days spent trying to refactor. 

## What's in for me? 

This plugin aims to reveal your dependencies during coding, so you'd get a chance to take care of them appropriately. Consider following practical cases: 

* Dependency that should not be there 
* Surprising class depends on yours 
* Cyclic dependencies considered generally evil, except for the classes in the same package 

## How does it look like?

It's an additional panel you can activate:

## Availability 

Current version support Java Android projects only. Chances are more support follows, as far as I add some more dependencies to this project.
